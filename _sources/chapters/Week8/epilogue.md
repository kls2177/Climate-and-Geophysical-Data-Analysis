Epilogue
==================================

This brings us to the end of the courseware for *Climate and Geophysical Data Analysis*. Although, the courseware is far from exhaustive, it provides an overview of the common methods and tools used in the fields of climate science and geophysics.

If you are interested in learning more, you can check out these two other online course offerings:

* [Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science][ldeo]
* [Earth Lab][earthlab]
* [Project Pythia][prjpyth]

There are also several other python packages that are really useful for analyzing climate and geophysical data sets, including:

* [xarray][xray]
* [pandas][pds]
* [xclim][xclm]
* [rioxarray][rio]

Finally, beyond python, there are several very useful tools for processing large climate data sets, including:

* [NetCDF Operators][nco]
* [Climate Data Operators][cdo]
* [NCAR Command Language][ncl]
