    "- **critical value**: $z_c$, the value of $z$ that must be exceeded to reject the null hypothesis. The value of $z_c$ depends on the formulation of your alternative hypothesis, i.e. is a one-sided $z_{\\alpha}$, two-sided $z_{\\alpha/2}$ test appropriate (more on this below).\n",

This means that we are testing whether there is a signal but we do not know the sign of the signal, e.g. the alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean is different from the population mean, but we don't know whether it's greater than or less than the population mean. This is a more conservative test. In specific cases, a one-sided test may be appropriate (follow this [link](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-the-differences-between-one-tailed-and-two-tailed-tests/) to learn more).\n",
