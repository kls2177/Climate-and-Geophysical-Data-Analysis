Descriptive Statistics
=======================

(under construction)

Before we do any fancy statistical analysis, we should first compute some simple *descriptive* statistics and generate a few simple plots. There is so much that we can establish by simply exploring the basic structure of our data. For example, simple statistics (e.g. mean) and histograms can expose missing data or extreme (maybe erroneous) outliers and raw time series plots can reveal trends and cyclic variability in our data.

The following video provides a brief introduction before we dive into the formal definitions in this section.
