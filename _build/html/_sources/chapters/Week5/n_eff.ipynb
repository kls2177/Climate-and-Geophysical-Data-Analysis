    "# Accounting for Autocorrelation: Effective Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that persistence/autocorrelation in a data set means that our sample size is actually an overestimate, because each data point is not independent of those around it. To deal with this problem, we can decrease $N$ to reflect the degree of autocorrelation in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most convenient way to do this is to introduce an **effective sample size, $N^*$**, where $N^*$ < $N$. So, we substitute $N^*$ in the place of $N$ in the formulas for the standard errors of the mean, regression, slope, intercept, etc. and in the degrees of freedom for the $t$-statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you are probably asking yourself, where does the *red noise* come in? The estimation of $N^*$ is generally approached assuming that a given time series behaves like a red noise time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using [this assumption](https://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article/12/6/1066/349434/The-Standard-Error-of-Time-Average-Estimates-of), $N^*$ can be estimated using the following [approximation](https://www.elsevier.com/books/statistical-methods-in-the-atmospheric-sciences/wilks/978-0-12-751965-4):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{N^*}{N} = \\frac{1-\\rho(\\Delta t)}{1+\\rho(\\Delta t)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of data points in the time series, $\\Delta t$ is the time step and $\\rho(\\Delta t)$ is the lag-1 autocorrelation, i.e., the coefficient $a$ in the equation for a red noise time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of $N^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "- for white noise, $\\rho(\\Delta t)$ = 0 -> N* = N\n",
    "- as $\\rho(\\Delta t)$ increases, $N^*$ decreases\n",
