# How to use this book

This courseware uses [Jupyter Notebooks][jupyter] to display python code and it uses [binder][bndr] and [Thebe][thebe] to allow users to interact with the code.

*Note that Google Chrome or Safari are* ***compatible browsers.***

There are two approaches to using this courseware. The first and recommended is to install your own copy of python on your laptop or desktop computer and to follow along with the course. You are able to copy and paste the python code into your own Jupyter Notebook and then interact with it yourself.

I recommend installing python using the [Anaconda distribution][anaconda]. Follow the installation steps [here][install].

Alternatively, you can simply interact with the code using the "Live Code/Launch Thebe" button in the upper right corner of the website.

You can also do both - use the live code option and copy/paste into your own notebook!
