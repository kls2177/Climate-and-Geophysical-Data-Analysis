    "# Goodness of Fit\n",

    "How much we trust that the regression coefficient, $a_{1}$, reflects the true relationship between $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ depends on the spread of the points about the best fit line. [Figure 12](goodness) illustrates this point. On the right, we see that the points cluster closely to the best fit line, while on the left, the points are more spread out and do not correspond to the best fit line as well.\n",

    "## Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start to write down the expression for the correlation coefficient. What we aim to do is to come up with an expression that tells us how much of the original variance in $y(t)$ is captured by the fit, $\\hat{y}(t)$. We will start by defining the total sum of squares for $y(t)$, $S_{yy}$,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially the variance of $y(t)$ except that we are not dividing by $N$, just to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",

    "You can prove to yourself that $\\overline{\\hat{y}}$ = $\\overline{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we have the two parts of the expression that we need. The ratio of $S_{\\hat{y}\\hat{y}}$ to $S_{yy}$ tells of the fraction of the totoal variance in $y(t)$ explained by the variance of the fit. This ratio is called the **coefficient of determination, $r^2$**. The coefficient of determination is the correlation coefficient squared!\n",
