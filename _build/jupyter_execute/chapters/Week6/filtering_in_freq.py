# # Filtering in the Frequency Domain: Discrete Fourier Transform
# 
# In the previous sections, we learned several methods of filtering and smoothing data in the time domain. A much more powerful way of filtering data is in the *frequency* domain. 
# 
# To work in the frequency domain, we will build on the concept of Fourier series and introduce the **Fourier Transform**. The Fourier Transform allows us to determine the time scales of variability of a time series by decomposing the time series into its harmonic components. We are going to explore how this is done by using the concept of [regression](https://kls2177.github.io/Climate-and-Geophysical-Data-Analysis/chapters/Week3/basics_linreg.html), i.e., thinking of a Fourier series as a fitted time series where the predictors are the sines and cosines. 
# 
# Just like linear regression, we are working towards an expression of the *fraction of variance explained* by the fits with the different harmonic components.
# 
# Let's begin.
# 
# ## Setting up the problem
# 
# In the case of a time series, $y(t)$ consisting of *discrete*, evenly spaced data:
# 
# Consider the domain 0 $\leq t \leq T$, where 0 and $T$ coincide with data points 1 and $N$+1, and $N$ is an even number. Recall that we can write $y(t)$ as,
# 
# $$
# y(t) = A_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{N/2} A_k\text{cos}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T}) +  \sum_{k=1}^{N/2} B_k\text{sin}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})
# $$
# 
# Thus, we need to solve for the intercept, $A_0$, and the regression coefficients, $A_k$ and $B_k$.
# 
# ### A few things to note...
# 
# 1.  the average of each sine/cosine function on the interval from $t_1$ = 0 to $t_N+1$ = $T$ is equal to 0, so, $A_0$ = $\overline{y}$.
# 2.  the harmonic functions (the predictors) are mutually orthogonal on the interval, i.e., the correlation ($\rho$) between sine and cosine functions is zero and the correlation between sine or cosine functions with different integer wavenumbers is also zero.
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# \rho(\text{sin(x)},\text{cos(x)}) & = 0\\
# \rho(\text{cos(x)},\text{cos(2x)}) & = 0
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# 3. the regression coefficients of $y(t)$ regressed onto the harmonic function can be written as,
# 
# $$
# A_k, B_k = \frac{\overline{x_k^{\prime}y^{\prime}}}{\overline{x_k^{\prime 2}}}
# $$
# 
# where,
# 
# $$
# x_k = \text{cos}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})
# $$
# 
# for $A_k$ and 
# 
# $$
# x_k = \text{sin}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})
# $$
# 
# for $B_k$.
# 
# 4. the harmonic functions all have variance, $\overline{x_k^{\prime 2}} = \frac{1}{2}$, except for $k = N$/2, when the variance of the cosine term is 1 and the variance of the sine term is 0.
# 
# From the above, the solutions for each predictor, $A_k$ and $B_k$ reduce to:
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# A_k & = 2\overline{\text{cos}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})y^{\prime}}\\
# B_k & = 2\overline{\text{sin}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})y^{\prime}}\\
# A_{N/2} & = \overline{\text{cos}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})y^{\prime}}\\
# B_{N/2} & = 0
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# where the 2 in front of the coefficients comes from the fact that $\overline{x_k^{\prime 2}} = \frac{1}{2}$.
# 
# Thus, $y(t)$ can be written as follows,
# 
# $$
# y(t) = \overline{y} + \sum_{k=1}^{N/2-1}\left( A_k\text{cos}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T}) +  B_k\text{sin}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})\right) + A_{N/2}\text{cos}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T})
# $$
# 
# For simplicity, we can convert the above into phase-amplitude form:
# 
# $$
# y(t) = \overline{y} + \sum_{k=1}^{N/2}C_k\text{cos}(2\pi k \frac{t}{T} - \phi_k)
# $$
# 
# where
# 
# $$
# C_k^2 = A_k^2 + B_k^2
# $$
# 
# This follows from the pythagorean theorem, with $A_k$ along the $x$-axis and $B_k$ along the $y$ and the angle $\phi_k$ representing the angle between the two. Here is a little video illustrating this [conversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zfefPUgSSY) intuitively and here two others ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTo8slkc11M) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNuxiNGjDpY)) going through the proof.

# 
# ## Fourier Decomposition
# 
# Before we move ahead to the Fourier Transform, let's just take a look at how we can generate Fourier components of time series using the above expressions. For this, we will use the [El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index](https://github.com/kls2177/ccia_files/blob/master/NINO34_monthly_Jan1958_Dec2019.csv?raw=true).

# load packages
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rc('font',size=16,weight='bold') #set default font size and weight for plots


# We will load in the NINO3.4 ENSO index from Jan. 1958 - Dec. 2019.

# In[2]:


# load data
filename = 'NINO34_monthly_Jan1958_Dec2019.csv'
ENSO = np.squeeze(np.genfromtxt(filename, delimiter = ',')) 

# let's also reshape ENSO into one long time series
Ny,Nm = ENSO.shape
ENSO = np.reshape(ENSO,Ny*Nm)


# What does this time series look like? Can we see different time scales of variability in the data?

# In[3]:


# plot ENSO time series
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.plot(ENSO)
plt.title('ENSO Time Series (1958-2019)')
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.xlim(0,len(ENSO))
plt.show()


# Let's construct the component of this time series representing the 5-year frequency using harmonics. We will start by writing down our parameters.

# In[4]:


# let's start with some parameters
# we are using monthly data, so the 5-year frequency and wavenumber are:

yr = 5.166666667 # note that we are using not exactly 5 years, such that k is an integer

# frequency
f = 1/float(12*yr)

# period
T = float(len(ENSO))

# wavenumber
k = f*T
print("The wavenumber is",k)

# time variable
time = np.arange(0,len(ENSO))

# argument for sine and cosine functions
theta = 2*np.pi*time*f


# Now, let's write down the sine and cosine functions using the `theta` argument above.

# In[5]:


# do fourier decomposition (calculate sines and cosines for a given frequency)
coskd = np.cos(theta)
sinkd = np.sin(theta)


# We can now write out the harmonic coefficients, $A_k$ and $B_k$.

# In[6]:


#  Calculate the coefficients for the harmonics
ak = 2*np.mean(coskd * ENSO)
bk = 2*np.mean(sinkd * ENSO)


# For convenience, we will convert to the amplitude-phase format.

# In[7]:


# convert to amplitude and phase format
ck = np.sqrt(ak**2 + bk**2)
lk = np.arctan2(bk,ak)/k


# Thus, the 5-year frequency component of the ENSO time series is:

# In[8]:


# construct the 5-year frequency component of the ENSO time series
ENSO_5yr = ck*np.cos(theta - lk)


# We can plot the original ENSO time series and the 5-year frequency component on the same graph to see how much of the variability we have captured.

# In[9]:


# plot original ENSO time series and 5-year component
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))

plt.plot(ENSO_5yr, label='5-year component')

# ## Variance Explained: Discrete Fourier Transform!
# 
# Back to examining $y(t)$ regressed on the harmonic components. We can express the *fraction of variance explained* by each harmonic component in the same way that we did for linear regression. Specifically, the fraction of variance explained by wavenumber, $k$, is,
# 
# $$
# R_k^2 = \frac{(\overline{x_k^{\prime}y^{\prime}})^2}{\overline{x_k^{\prime 2}}\overline{y^{\prime 2}}}
# $$
# 
# 
# This should look very similar to the *coefficient of determination* for linear regression, but now we can write down an $R$-squared for each wavenumber.
# 
# Noticing that much of this expression looks like the expressions for $A_k$ and $B_k$, we can re-write the above as,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# R_k^2 &= \frac{A_k^2}{2\overline{y^{\prime 2}}} \quad \text{for the cosine functions}\\
# R_k^2 &= \frac{B_k^2}{2\overline{y^{\prime 2}}} \quad \text{for the sine functions}\\
# R_k^2 &= \frac{A_{N/2}^2}{\overline{y^{\prime 2}}} \quad \text{for the special case of $k=N/2$}
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# This is basically what we want in order to determine how much of the variance in $y(t)$ comes from different harmonic components. Thus, the fraction of variance explained by each harmonic pair (sine + cosine) is,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# R_k^2 &= \frac{A_k^2 + B_k^2}{2\overline{y^{\prime 2}}}\\
# & = \frac{C_k^2}{2\overline{y^{\prime 2}}}
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# We can approximate the variance of $y(t)$ as $\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N/2}C_k^2}{2}$ such that,
# 
# $$
# R_k^2 = \frac{C_k^2}{\sum_{k=1}^{N/2}C_k^2}
# $$
# 
# We have just found the **discrete Fourier Transform**! A plot of $\frac{C_k^2}{\sum_{k=1}^{N/2}C_k^2}$ versus $k$ or $f$ is the *discrete power spectrum* of $y(t)$, where we use the word *power* and *variance* interchangeably. [Figure 21](DFT) shows discrete Fourier Transforms of a sine wave and a square wave.

# Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of (a) a sine wave (k = 4) and (b) a square wave.
# ```
# 
# Now, let's take a look at the DFT of the ENSO time series. We will loop over all the possible wavenumbers from $k$ = 1 to $k$ = $N$/2 and compute the corresponding fraction of variance expained.

# In[10]:


# compute variance as a function of k
time = np.arange(0,len(ENSO))
k_all = np.arange(1,len(ENSO)/2+1)
ck2 = []
for i in k_all:
    T = float(len(ENSO))
    k = i
    theta = 2*np.pi*time*k/T
    
    coskd = np.cos(theta)
    sinkd = np.sin(theta)
    
    ak = ENSO*coskd
    bk = ENSO*sinkd

    ak_mean = np.mean(ak)*2
    bk_mean = np.mean(bk)*2
    
    #Use the Pythagorean Theorem to convert to amplitude and phase format
    ck2.append((ak_mean**2 + bk_mean**2)/2)
ck2 = np.asarray(ck2)


# Let's check that the variance of the ENSO time series is roughly approximated by $\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N/2}C_k^2}{2}$

# In[11]:


# compare variance of ENSO with total variance of harmonic components
print(np.round(np.var(ENSO),5),np.round(np.sum(ck2),5))


# Pretty close - great! Now, let's plot the fraction of variance explained, sometimes called the *normalized power*, as a function of wavenumber, $k$.

# In[12]:


# plot discrete power spectrum
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.bar(k_all,ck2/np.sum(ck2))
plt.ylabel('Normalized Power')
plt.xlabel('Wavenumber')


# Most of the power is in the low frequencies. Let's see which frequencies these are:

# In[13]:


# compute frequencies that correspond to first 62 wavenumbers
f = k_all[0:62]/T

# print in terms of years
print(1/(12*f))


# This is consistent with what we know about ENSO - it is a low-frequency oscillation with the majority of the power in the 3-7 year range.
# 
# ### Drawbacks of DFT:
# 
# While the discrete power spectrum is fine if we have an infinite sample, it has serious drawbacks if we only have a finite data record:
# 
# - integral values of $k$ do not have any special relationship to the population being sampled, and are completely dependent on the length of the data record $T$ which is presumably arbitrary.
# 
# - the individual spectral lines each contain about 2 degrees of freedom: $N$+1 data points were used to determine, $N$/2 amplitudes and $N$/2 - 1 phases.
# 
# - except for diurnal/seasonal cycles, most geophysical phenomena are only quasi-periodic, and thus, do not conform to the idea of a single integer wavenumber, but are likely better represented as spectral bands of finite width.
# 
# These considerations suggest the notion of a **continuous power spectrum**, where the variance $y(t)$ is given per unit frequency (or wavenumber). This is what we will cover in the next section.
