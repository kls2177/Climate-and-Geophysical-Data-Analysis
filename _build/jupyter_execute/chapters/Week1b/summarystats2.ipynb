    "## 3. Higher Moments\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, all statistical moments are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\\overline{x^{\\prime r}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\overline{x})^r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r$ denotes the moment (e.g. $r$ = 2 is the variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and fourth moments are known as the **skewness** and **kurtosis** and these describe the shape of a distribution. In practice, these sample moments are typically reported in their *standardized* form as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_r = \\frac{\\overline{x^{\\prime r}}}{s^r}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "The **skewness** indicates the degree of asymmetry of the distribution about the mean. $\\alpha_3$ > 0 indicates that the distribution has a long tail on the positive side of the mean and $\\alpha$ < 0 indicates a long tail on the negative side of the mean. Note a normal distribution has $\\alpha$ = 0 (we will discuss the normal distribution in the next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Kurtosis\n",
    "\n",
    "The **kurtosis** describes the shape of a distribution’s tails relative to the rest of the distribution. A normal distribution has $\\alpha_4$ = 3. $\\alpha_4$ > 3 indicates a more peaked distribution compared to normal (*leptokurtic*) and $\\alpha_4$ < 3 indicates a flatter distribution (*platykurtic*).\n",
